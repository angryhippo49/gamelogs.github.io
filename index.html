            <p>July 25, 2025</p>
                <p>I’m thinking of trying to commit genocide in all of the towns 
                in Red Dead Redemption 2. Let me back up. It was just a normal 
                night on the game. I was playing as John Marston, wearing a bright 
                orange tuxedo and riding my horse through the dark streets of Saint Denis. I then 
                saw a police officer start beating up a civilian. Naturally, I stepped in to 
                intervene. When I called for the cop to stop, he turned his attention to 
                me and attacked. I tried to defuse the situation, but he kept chasing me. 
                Eventually, I threw a punch and knocked him out. Suddenly, I have the wanted 
                notification on the top right of my screen, and cops are flooding in from 
                everywhere to kill me. I realize this is too much for me to handle, so I ride 
                off on the fastest horse in the game, a beautiful white saudi-arabian horse, Bob, 
                when they shoot him twice in the neck. He falls to the ground. Any person who has 
                played Red Dead Redemption before can understand he guilt and sadness one feels 
                when they lose their horse. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t have enough time 
                to mourn my loss, however. The cops were advancing on the barrel I was hiding 
                behind, and I was running out of ammunition, so I jumped onto the conveniently 
                placed trolley that was driving by me. I then jumped off because I realized the 
                trolley was too slow and stole a random horse and rode off in a random direction to 
                escape. I managed to get to the small town of Valentine before I allowed myself to 
                refuel with a drink, a bath, and a restock of ammunition. This brings me to where I 
                am now. I must get revenge for Bob by diminishing the population of Valentine, Rhodes, 
                and Saint Denis, respectively. I’m thinking of using fire bottles and dynamite for 
                Valentine, because it is the smallest and least protected town out of the three, and 
                the structures are nicely packed together and look flammable. I haven’t worked out 
                what I’ll do for Rhodes, but I will hopefully be able to get my hands on a Gatling 
                gun for Saint Denis because I learned not so long ago, they have a very high security 
                system. It might not even be possible if the game auto-spawns in cops when you do a 
                bad thing, which will just result in me running out of ammunition by the first town and dying.
