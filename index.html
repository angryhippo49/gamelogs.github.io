            <p>July 19, 2025
                I replayed Red Dead Redemption 2 to see how much better it would be 
                if I took the high honor path of Arthur Morgan. This means as little
                killing as possible, not antagonizing anyone, always helping anyone 
                you find, and not following random people until they get scared and 
                run out of the town, leaving them vulnerable for you to tie them up 
                and feed them to alligators; the usual. So far, I am not as low honor
                as I was on my original gameplay, but I still didnâ€™t have enough to be 
                considered high honor. Tonight, I might hop on just to spend my whole 
                hour catching fish and throwing them back to regain the honor lost from 
                spamming the antagonize button on people, hoping they give me an excuse to fight 
                them. I also want to experience some of the side missions and question marks 
                on the map as Arthur. On my first play-through, I was focused on finishing 
                the main story or going on killing sprees. This time, I want to take my 
                time and enjoy the game as Arthur because I know what happens to him at the end. 
                I wanted to make sure he had a significant positive impact on the gang members 
                after he died as well, because if you visit his grave after you reach 100% 
                completion, there are tons of flowers there if he were high honor, but 
                nothing if he was low honor.</p>
